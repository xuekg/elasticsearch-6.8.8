== Cross cluster search, tribe, clients, and integrations

When using {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[Cross Cluster Search] or
{ref}/modules-tribe.html[Tribe Nodes] you need to take extra steps to secure
communications with the connected clusters.

* <<cross-cluster-configuring,{ccs-cap}>>
* <<tribe-node-configuring,Tribe nodes and security>>

You will need to update the configuration for several clients to work with a
secured cluster:

* <<java-clients,Java clients>>
* <<http-clients,HTTP clients>>


The {es} {security-features} enable you to secure your {es} cluster. But
{es} itself is only one product within the {stack}. It is often the case that
other products in the stack are connected to the cluster and therefore need to
be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:

* <<hadoop, Apache Hadoop>>
