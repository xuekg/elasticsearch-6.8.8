=== Stop {dfeeds} API

[subs="attributes"]
++++
<titleabbrev>Stop {dfeeds}</titleabbrev>
++++

Stops one or more {dfeeds}.

A {dfeed} that is stopped ceases to retrieve data from {es}.
A {dfeed} can be started and stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle.

==== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/datafeeds/<feed_id>/_stop` +

`POST _xpack/ml/datafeeds/<feed_id>,<feed_id>/_stop` +

`POST _xpack/ml/datafeeds/_all/_stop`


===== Description

You can stop multiple {dfeeds} in a single API request by using a
comma-separated list of {dfeeds} or a wildcard expression. You can close all
{dfeeds} by using `_all` or by specifying `*` as the `<feed_id>`.


==== Path Parameters

`feed_id`::
  (string) Identifier for the {dfeed}. It can be a {dfeed} identifier or a
  wildcard expression.

`allow_no_datafeeds`::
  (Optional, boolean) Specifies what to do when the request:
+
--
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are no {datafeeds} that match.
* Contains the `_all` string or no identifiers and there are no matches.
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are only partial matches. 

The default value is `true`, which returns an empty `datafeeds` array when
there are no matches and the subset of results when there are partial matches.
If this parameter is `false`, the request returns a `404` status code when there
are no matches or only partial matches.
--

==== Request Body

`force`::
  (boolean) If true, the {dfeed} is stopped forcefully.

`timeout`::
  (time) Controls the amount of time to wait until a {dfeed} stops.
  The default value is 20 seconds.

`404` (Missing resources)::
  If `allow_no_datafeeds` is `false`, this code indicates that there are no
  resources that match the request or only partial matches for the request.
